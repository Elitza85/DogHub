<ul>
<li>The new world requires a new way of doing the old stuff. This encompasses also the conducting of dog competitions. The DogHub Experience Platform gives the opportunity to dog owners to register their dogs in a dog catalogue, so that they have a wide presence in the world of dog mania.</li>
<li>Every registered dog has the opportunity to participate in a dog competition, as long as it covers the competition requirements. Every dog competitor will be judged by regular voters and by eligible judges during a competition that is in progress.</li>
<li>The dog owner has the option to find a dog partner for his own dog.</li>
</ul>
